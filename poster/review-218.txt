The Review

   The poster details a system for the visualization of earthquake
   experiments from a shake table. The task description is too generic â€“
   from the formulation, it is not clear how the specific design follows.
   The description jumps between high-level (tasks) and low-level
   (implementation). I believe if this is cleaned up, this would be a good
   poster.

   Also, please utilize a spell checker, and use the correct template (not
   the TVCG one).

The Review

   The poster describes an interesting system for the visualization of
   earthquake experiments on a shake table. The approach of using NLP /  bag
   of words of the recorded signals seems novel. However, the abstract is a
   bit unfocused and reads a bit choppy (e.g., implementation details thrown
   in between tasks and description of method. There is no connection
   between the tasks listed and the analysis/visualization. How does the
   analysis/visualization address the task requirements. Further, some
   motivation of the choices for the analysis/visualization method should be
   given (do not only describe how you visualize things but also why this is
   useful). The abstract uses the wrong template (TVCG instead of
   conference) and needs to be reformatted. The authors should also run a
   spell-checker and perform a proof-reading pass.
