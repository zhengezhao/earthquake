%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Course Dependency can greatly affect a student's grade because of their content. Making one course the prerequisite of another may improve the student's performance in the latter course dramatically. But given the vast number of courses in a university, finding a good prerequisite calls for expertise in all the courses. It's a challenge for not only the student herself, but sometimes the academic advisor if he happens to know little about the particular course. 

We proposed to compare students' historical grades to see the effect of setting prerequisite course. The visualization tool will use this as the weight in the correlation matrix. The tool includes a main view that shows the global relationship between each pair of courses, and a side view that shows details of one particular pair chosen by user.

We haven't got to the evaluation part yet. Plans will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:vis}
