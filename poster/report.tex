%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
  Computer simulations of the effect of earthquakes on built structures promise to let engineers understand different tradeoffs and designs at an attractively low cost.
  In this scenario, the bottleneck for the expert is one of \emph{data understanding}: how do different building designs respond to different earthquakes?
  What do the building failure modes have in common, and how does this compare to theoretical predictions?
  The way in which a building responds to an earthquakes is complex and controlled by different factors.
  In this poster, we present ongoing work in building a system for interactive visualization of earthquake simulation data, in collaboration with civil engineers who have run thousands of simulations, varying the height of the simulated buildings, ground acceleration, and building structure design.
  We describe the challenges in the visualization of such multivariate time series data, and some of our proposed solutions.
