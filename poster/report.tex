%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
In the civil construction, the key for building a robust building is the resistance to different disasters. Earthquake is one of the main threatens. The impact of earthquakes on buildings is complex and controlled by different factors. Visualizing earthquake simulations in a way which civil engineers can have a comprehensive understanding of what happened when an earthquake is shaking the building as well as all the detailed attributes. It is a great challenge since there is no trivial solutions about how to visualizing multivariate, multi-scale temporal data.We propose several approaches to visualize the earthquake simulation data from different perspectives. We laso present a few methods to compare these complicated simulation data quantitatively. 
%We haven't got to the evaluation part yet. Plans will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:vis}
