% Introduction and/or Motivation

Navigating the curriculum of educational institution, fulfilling prerequisite and choosing between course options has been a feature of the educational environment dating back to Plato’s inscription ``Let no one ignorant of geometry enter!'' inscribed at the entrance of his academy~\cite{anglin1994mathematics}. In efforts to remain competitive, course options at institutes of higher learning have exploded, often offering hundreds of course possibilities that satisfy their general education requirements~\cite{schwartz2009paradox}.

The real world scene is that coursework contents can be related, making one course as the prerequisite of the other will help students better learn knowledge and obtain better grades. Academic advisor, for example, deals with these issues a lot.

While some course dependencies have already been explicitly annotated in practice, more remain unclear and potential. In this work, we’d like to design a visualization view to group related courses in clusters based on student enrollment history, and another view to show correlations of two related courses based on the discrete grades of students who have enrolled both courses.

The aims of this research are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item provide a tool to visualize coursework contents similarity based on student membership.
  \item explore different diagrams to handle the complexity of information
  \item study simliarity metrics of two courses based on grade history of one student and multiple students.
\end{itemize}
